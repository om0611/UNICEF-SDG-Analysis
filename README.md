## Overview
This project aims to analyze the progress of South American countries towards achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by UNICEF and identify key factors that may be affecting their progress. Our analysis involves the use of various statistical methods, including k-means clustering, hypothesis testing, and linear regression. 

## Key Findings
- The proportion of South American countries on track toward their SDGs is equal to the proportion of non-South American countries.
- South American countries are struggling with SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).
- Level of education is positively correlated with average SDG score.
